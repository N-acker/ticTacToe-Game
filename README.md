This is a tic tac toe game made using Java. It has both single player or multiplayer options.

The entire game is played in the terminal.
The player can choose both single and multiplayer options. 
In the single player game the player is always X and thus starts first.
The user basically just chooses positions 1-9 on the board.
Once a position is chosen the cpu will play their position.
Once a position has been chosen by the user or the cpu neither can choose that position anymore.
The objective is to get a line of 3 Xs before the cpu can get a line with 3 Os.
The multiplayer option is the same as the single player option but instead of the cpu playing, another user will be playing. 

In making this game I learned how to utilize the minimax algorithm so that the user can play a challenging game against the cpu.
